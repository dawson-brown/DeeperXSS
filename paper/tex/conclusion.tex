Detecting and preventing XSS attacks remains an important domain of research. As such it is all the more important that research into this area remains reproducible and usable for practical purposes. In this paper we recreate, validate the DeepXSS approach for XSS detection. We also make comparisons to additional models to validate various claims. Ultimately we found that while DeepXSS is an extremely effective XSS classifier, claims surrounding the importance of Word2Vec for extracting semantic information are exaggerated. Our results indicate that deep learning should continue to be pursued as a means of classifying XSS. Future work should focus on extending this approach to web pages and embedded scripts to detect stored XSS attacks.  Additionally, expanding the recursive decoder to handle more encodings, and isolating the most important features for detecting XSS is an important extension of this work. The final goal should be integrating these classifiers with working systems so that they can help with real time detection and prevention of XSS attacks.
