\textbf{Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks pose a major threat to current Web applications. XSS very regularly ranks among the top ten most common attacks and vulnerabilities on the Web. As such, the successful detection and prevention of such attacks remain an active and important area of research. In this paper, we set out to replicate, critique, and expand on the DeepXSS approach proposed by Fang \text{et al.} DeepXSS gives a lackluster presentation of an LSTM classifier that boasts very high precision and recall rates. In order to better understand the application of deep learning techniques to XSS classification problems, we dissect their approach, try to recreate their impressive results and contribute some modifications, extensions, and alternative architectures. With this, we hope to justify and critique some of their choices and provide some context as to what works and what doesn't in deep learning XSS classifiers.}
